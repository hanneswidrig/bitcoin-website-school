## Projects made for Web Publishing Course taken in Spring 2016.
Web projects were created as part of the web publishing class I took last year. They only represent a portion of my web development skills.

## Project Summaries
1. **About Me**: Most developed project, makes use of CSS and JS for styling and photos display on site.
2. **Bitcoin**: Designed to display multi-page CSS and navigation.
3. **Test Navigation**: This was an early project, and only the CSS styling for the navigation stands out in particular.
