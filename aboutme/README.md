## Core Objectives of Assignment
- More reactive design
- Advanced CSS Styling
- JS Slideshow and multiple modes of navigation.

## Above and beyond
Website is **responsive** and uses pleasing font and background color contrast. I personally designed the CSS styling entirely from scratch and implemented a slightly modified JS slideshow. Professor did not expect us to make website responsive, this was done on my own inhibition.
