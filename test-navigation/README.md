## Core Objectives of Assignment
- Simple navigation
- Use of simple CSS styling

## Above and beyond
Professor only expected us to having a working website with some navigation, we were not expected to implement CSS styled button, just images. I used my prior knowledge of CSS to make a custom CSS styled vertical navigation bar and animate the buttons on the webpage. Website is partially responsive and contact page makes use of custom CSS styling.
